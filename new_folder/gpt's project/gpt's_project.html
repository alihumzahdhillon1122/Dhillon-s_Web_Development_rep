                <h2>Corruption in Pakistan</h2>
                <p>Corruption in Pakistan is a significant issue that affects various aspects of society, including the
                    economy, politics, and social welfare. We aim to raise awareness about the impact of corruption and
                    promote transparency and accountability.</p>

                <h2>Women's Rights</h2>
                <p>Women's rights are fundamental human rights that every individual, regardless of gender, should
                    enjoy. However, women in Pakistan often face discrimination, violence, and limited access to
                    education and employment opportunities. Our website advocates for gender equality and empowerment of
                    women.</p>
