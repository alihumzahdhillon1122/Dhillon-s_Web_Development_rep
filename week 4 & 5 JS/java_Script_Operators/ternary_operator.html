    <h1>Ternary opertor</h1>
    <p>The ternary operator, also known as the conditional operator, is a concise way to write conditional expressions in many programming languages, including JavaScript, C, and Java. It's called "ternary" because it operates on three operands.</p>
    <code>condition ? expression1 : expression2
    </code>
    <ul>
        <li>The condition is evaluated first. If the condition is true, the value of expression1 is returned. If the condition is false, the value of expression2 is returned.</li>
        <li>The condition can be any expression that evaluates to true or false. It's usually a comparison or a logical expression.</li>
        <li>expression1 and expression2 can be any valid expressions, including variables, literals, or function calls.</li>
    </ul> <br><br>
