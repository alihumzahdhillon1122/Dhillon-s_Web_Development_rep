    <h1>Conditional Statements</h1>
    <p>Conditional statements are used in programming to execute different blocks of code based on certain conditions. These statements allow you to control the flow of your program by making decisions.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>IF Statement</li>
        <li>IF-ELSe statement</li>
        <li>If-Elif-Else Statement</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>If Statement</h1>
    <p>An if statement checks a condition and executes a block of code if the condition evaluates to true. If the condition is false, the block of code is skipped.</p> <br> <br>
    <span><code>if condition:
        # Block of code to execute if condition is true
    </code></span>
    <h1>If-Else Statement</h1>
    <p>An if-else statement allows you to execute one block of code if the condition is true and another block of code if the condition is false</p> <br> <br>
    <span><code>if condition:
        # Block of code to execute if condition is true
    else:
        # Block of code to execute if condition is false
    </code></span>
