    <h1>switch statement</h1>
    <p>Switch statements in programming are control flow statements used to execute different blocks of code based on the value of a variable or expression. They provide a cleaner and more concise way to write multiple if-else statements when you have to compare the value of a variable against multiple possible values.</p> <br>
    <span>The syntax of a switch statement typically looks like this</span> <br>
    <span><code>switch (expression) {
        case value1:
          // Block of code to execute if expression === value1
          break;
        case value2:
          // Block of code to execute if expression === value2
          break;
        // Additional cases as needed...
        default:
          // Block of code to execute if expression doesn't match any case
      }
      </code></span> <br>
      <ul>
        <li>The switch keyword is followed by an expression (usually a variable or an expression that returns a value).</li>
        <li>Inside the curly braces {}, you specify one or more case blocks. Each case block represents a possible value of the expression</li>
        <li>When the switch statement is executed, the expression is evaluated, and control jumps to the case block that matches the value of the expression. If no match is found, control jumps to the default block (if it's present).</li>
        <li>The break statement is used to exit the switch statement after executing the corresponding block of code. If break is omitted, control will continue to the next case block, which can lead to unintended behavior.</li>
        <li>The default block is optional and is executed if none of the case blocks match the value of the expression</li>
      </ul> <br>
      <span>Here's a simple example of a switch statement in JavaScript</span> <br> <br>
      <code>let day = 3;
        let dayName;
        
        switch (day) {
          case 1:
            dayName = "Monday";
            break;
          case 2:
            dayName = "Tuesday";
            break;
          case 3:
            dayName = "Wednesday";
            break;
          case 4:
            dayName = "Thursday";
            break;
          case 5:
            dayName = "Friday";
            break;
          default:
            dayName = "Invalid day";
        }
        
        console.log(dayName); // Output: Wednesday
        </code>
        <p>In this example, day is set to 3, so the case 3 block is executed, and dayName is set to "Wednesday".
        </p>
