    <h1>Arrays</h1>
    <p>Arrays in JavaScript are used to store multiple values in a single variable. They allow you to store an ordered collection of elements, such as numbers, strings, objects, or even other arrays. Arrays in JavaScript are dynamic, meaning they can grow or shrink in size as needed.</p> <br>
    <span><code>let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
        let fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"];
        </code></span> <br>
