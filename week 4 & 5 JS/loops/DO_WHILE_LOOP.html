    <span><code>let i = 1;
        do {
            console.log(i);
            i++;
        } while (i <= 5);
        </code></span>
        <ul>
            <li>We initialize the variable i with the value 1 before the loop starts.</li>
            <li>The do keyword is followed by the block of code inside the loop, which includes console.log(i) to print the value of i to the console.</li>
            <li>After the code block, the while keyword is used to specify the condition (i <= 5). Unlike a regular while loop, the condition in a do-while loop is evaluated after the code block has been executed. This means that the code block will always execute at least once, even if the condition is initially false.</li>
            <li>Inside the loop, i++ is used to increment the value of i by 1 after each iteration.</li>
            <li>The loop continues to execute as long as the condition i <= 5 remains true. Once i becomes greater than 5, the condition becomes false, and the loop terminates</li>
        </ul>
