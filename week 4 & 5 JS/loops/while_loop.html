    <title>While LOOP</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h2>The syntax of a while loop is straightforward</h2> <br>
    <span><code>while condition:
        # Block of code to be executed repeatedly
    </code></span> <br>
    <ol>
        <li>The condition is evaluated before each iteration of the loop. If the condition is true, the block of code inside the loop is executed. If the condition is false, the loop terminates, and the program continues with the code after the loop.</li>
        <li>Inside the loop, you typically perform some operations that may change the value of variables used in the condition. This allows the condition to eventually become false and exit the loop.</li>
    </ol> <br>
    <code>let i = 1;
        while (i <= 5) {
            console.log(i);
            i++;
        }
        </code> <br>
