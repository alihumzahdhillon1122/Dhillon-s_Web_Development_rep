    <h1>LOOPs</h1>
    <p>A for loop is a control flow statement that allows you to execute a block of code repeatedly based on a specified condition. It's commonly used when you know exactly how many times you want to iterate through a block of code.</p>
    <h2>The syntax of a for loop typically consists of three parts</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Initialization</b>You initialize a variable and set its initial value before the loop starts. This part is executed only once at the beginning of the loop.</li>
        <li><b>Condition</b> You specify a condition that is evaluated before each iteration of the loop. If the condition evaluates to true, the loop continues; otherwise, the loop terminates. </li>
        <li><b>Increment/Decrement</b>  You specify an increment or decrement operation that is performed after each iteration of the loop. This part allows you to update the loop control variable. </li>
    </ul>
    <h1>FOR LOOP</h1> <br>
    <span>Here's the general syntax of a for loop</span> <br>
    <span><code>for initialization; condition; increment/decrement:
        # Block of code to be executed repeatedly
    </code></span> <br>
    <p>For example, a for loop in Python to print numbers from 1 to 5 would look like this</p> <br>
    <span><code>for i in range(1, 6):
        print(i)
    </code></span> <br>
    <p>In this example:

        i is the loop control variable that is initialized to 1.
        The loop continues as long as i is less than or equal to 5.
        After each iteration, i is incremented by 1.
        Inside the loop, print(i) prints the value of i.</p>
